# Emoji Day

This repository is coming almost a full month late (on 2023, Tuesday, August 15th) There was another repository scheduled for creation today ([:octocat: `WacOS Docs`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_Docs/)) and since it was already created, I decided to pick this one out of my queue.

I also regard Emoji day as Unicode day, as no day for Unicode exists yet.

I only have 1 Emoji proposal at the moment. You can see proposals [`here`](/Proposals/)

This [`README.md`](/README.md) file should get a proper rewrite next Emoji Day (2024, Wednesday, July 17th)
