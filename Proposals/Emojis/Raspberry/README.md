# Raspberry Emoji

We have so many other less common fruit emojis, for example, the eggplant emoji had no significant original use, and is mostly just a phallic expression now. The raspberry would be a great Emoji, as:

- It can represent the Raspberry Pi and other technical projects that use a raspberry as their logo/name (and people can stop using strawberries as a placeholder)
- It can represent the Golden Raspberry Awards
- It can represent the Bronx Cheer (blowing a raspberry) when combined with other Emojis
- Raspberries are a really good berry
- The raspberry has a unique texture that no other emojis have (the closest would be the strawberry emoji)
